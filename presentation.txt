Zuerst die Warum-Frage beantworten - siehe TED talk Simon Sinek.

We have access to so much data and yet in the area of gardening we don't use it as much as we could. There are so many calendars for gardening both online and in print. But when you want to know what to do with your plant xy today, you have to scan the internet, read through all those descriptions on how to handle that particular plant until you find that little piece of information what to do with it now. And in addition, there are thousands of different ways of doing it and when doing it that it s all confusing. So the only thing you can do is to choose one out of the blue.

What I wish is to collect all relevant data in order to know what to do exactly with each of my plants. We can take into account wheater data, your soil, planting time, etc. There are so many influences on how healthy a plant will grow it s definitely going to be a very difficult task.

If we can build a platform or an app that can tell you exactly what would be the best treatment for your plant right now then gardening is going to be a piece of cake for everyone - no matter if you are a beginner or not. This could help everyone to grow their own food wherever there is a little space to do so.

Plants do need a certain amount of certain nutrients, a certain amount of water, etc.
If we do it right and take all informations that we have into account then we could provide everyone with the best tipp on what your plant needs and it will grow perfectly.
